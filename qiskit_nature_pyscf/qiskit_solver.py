class QiskitSolver:
    """A Qiskit-based FCI solver for PySCF.

    This class bridges the APIs of PySCF and Qiskit Nature. You can use an instance of it to
    overwrite the ``fcisolver`` attribute of a :class:`pyscf.mcscf.casci.CASCI` object, in order to
    use a Quantum algorithm as provided by Qiskit for the CI solution step.
    Depending on the algorithm and its configuration, this may **not** result in the true FCI
    result, so care must be taken when using this class.

    Here is an example use case:

    .. code-block:: python

        from pyscf import gto, scf, mcscf

        from qiskit.algorithms.minimum_eigensolvers import VQE
        from qiskit.algorithms.optimizers import SLSQP
        from qiskit.primitives import Estimator
        from qiskit_nature.second_q.algorithms import GroundStateEigensolver
        from qiskit_nature.second_q.circuit.library import HartreeFock, UCCSD
        from qiskit_nature.second_q.mappers import ParityMapper

        from qiskit_nature_pyscf import QiskitSolver

        mol = gto.M(atom="Li 0 0 0; H 0 0 1.51", basis="631g*")

        h_f = scf.RHF(mol).run()

        norb = 2
        nalpha, nbeta = 1, 1
        nelec = nalpha + nbeta

        cas = mcscf.CASCI(h_f, norb, nelec)

        mapper = ParityMapper(num_particles=(nalpha, nbeta))

        ansatz = UCCSD(
            norb,
            (nalpha, nbeta),
            mapper,
            initial_state=HartreeFock(
                norb,
                (nalpha, nbeta),
                mapper,
            ),
        )

        vqe = VQE(Estimator(), ansatz, SLSQP())
        vqe.initial_point = np.zeros(ansatz.num_parameters)

        algorithm = GroundStateEigensolver(mapper, vqe)

        cas.fcisolver = QiskitSolver(algorithm)

        cas.run()

        solver: a ground-state solver provided by Qiskit Nature. This must be supplied by the user
            prior to running the algorithm.
        density: an ElectronicDensity provided by Qiskit Nature. This is only available after the
            first iteration of the algorithm.
        result: an ElectronicStructureResult provided by Qiskit Nature. This is only available after
