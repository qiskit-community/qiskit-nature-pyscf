    """A PySCF-based GroundStateSolver for Qiskit Nature.

    This class provides a :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.algorithms.GroundStateSolver` for Qiskit
    Nature, leveraging the ``fci`` module of PySCF. This is utility does not enable any Quantum
    algorithms to be used (since it replaces them in the Qiskit workflow) but instead provides a
    useful utility for debugging classical computational workflows based on Qiskit Nature.
    More importantly, it provides a more efficient implementation of what Qiskit otherwise achieves
    using a :class:`~qiskit_algorithms.NumPyMinimumEigensolver` in combination with a
    ``filter_criterion``. For non-singlet spin ground states the setup using Qiskit components is a
    lot more involved, whereas this class provides an easy-to-use alternative.

    Here is an example use cas:

    .. code-block:: python

       from pyscf import fci

       from qiskit_nature.second_q.drivers import MethodType, PySCFDriver
       from qiskit_nature.second_q.transformers import ActiveSpaceTransformer

       from qiskit_nature_pyscf import PySCFGroundStateSolver

       driver = PySCFDriver(
           atom="O 0.0 0.0 0.0; O 0.0 0.0 1.5",
           basis="sto3g",
           spin=2,
           method=MethodType.UHF,
       )
       problem = driver.run()

       transformer = ActiveSpaceTransformer(4, 4)

       problem = transformer.transform(problem)

       solver = PySCFGroundStateSolver(fci.direct_uhf.FCI())

       result = solver.solve(problem)
       print(result)
