    The :class:`.PySCFGroundStateSolver` now also computes the magnetization ($S^z$)
    and total angular momentum ($S^2$) values for all computes roots. In doing so,
    it properly takes the alpha-beta overlap matrix from the
    ``qiskit_nature.second_q.properties.AngularMomentum.overlap`` property into account.
    When this overlap is non-unitary, the spin-contamination within the active subspace
    is computed correctly. For more details, see also:
